# Azure Detection Lab using Microsoft Sentinal ðŸ“œðŸ“Š

## Objective
âœ¨ The Microsoft Azure Detection Lab using Sentinel is a dedicated environment designed for cybersecurity professionals to enhance their threat detection and response skills within Azure environments. This practical aims to configure and deploy Azure resources such as Log Analytics Workspace, Virtual Machines, and Azure Sentinel, with custom analytic rules to detect Microsoft Security Events.


### Skills Learned

- Deploying Azure Resources such as Log Analytics Workspace, Virtual Machines, and Azure Sentinel.
- Configuring data connectors to allow data to be brought into sentinal for analysis.
- Understanding of a new Azure language (KQL) to query logs.
- Searching log data and creating custom rules for data analysis.


## Steps

âœ¨ LAB NAME: Azure Detection Lab using Microsoft Sentinal

âœ¨ OBJECTIVE: The aim is to configure and deploy Azure resources using sentinal to extract and observe log data into one centralized location.

âœ¨ THEORY: Connectors will be used as pre-built methods to connect the API calls.

To prevent unauthorized login, network security groups (NSG) are modified ensuring inbound facing ports are configured. The security feature "just in time" provides necessary time-based restrictions while also ensuring the principle of least privilege.
